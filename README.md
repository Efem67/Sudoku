# Sudoku

After launching the application, with the command "npm run dev", we will be asked to upload a JSON file with an array of digits (correct JSON files are in the array folder), upload the file goodArray1 - the application will fill the fields automatically in the player's ignorance. You can also create your own file, and put 0 instead of empty fields.

Using the arrows, we can move around the fields where you need to type the numbers from the keyboard. The correct numbers will be highlighted in green. We are also able to type hints in the fields after checking the checkbox.

The buttons in the upper right corner are responsible for dissolving sets and saving the game state.
